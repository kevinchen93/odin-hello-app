# Ruby on Rails Tutorial -- "hello, world!"

This purpose of this project was to develop a web application with Ruby on Rails and deploy it to a hosted platform (Heroku).

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails-basics).


## Pre-Project Thoughts

Note: At this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, Chrome Dev Tool, and Git skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

I create a functional (if minimal) web application. One thing the page is definitely missing is a more appealing landing page. More
features can be added. I will learn how later on in the curriculum.

Skills I demonstrated or strengthened at project end: 
-Generated a new application using `rails new` and ran a local server using
`rails server` both on a command-line terminal <br>
-Added a controller action and modified the root route to create a "hello, world"
application <br>
-Protected against data loss while enabling collaboration by placing application 
source code under version control with Git and pushing code to GitHub <br>
-Deployed application to a production environment using Heroku
